# SOC Incident Analysis Tool

A web-based tool designed to assist Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts in analyzing, masking, and reporting on security incidents. This application provides an interface to process security logs, sanitize sensitive configuration data, and generate standardized event analysis reports.

## 🚀 Features

- **Log Analysis**: Input raw security logs for parsing and review.
- **Data Masking**: Automatically detects and masks sensitive information (like API keys, passwords, and IP addresses) from logs to ensure safe sharing.
- **AI-Powered Insights**: (Optional) Integration with AI models to provide automated analysis and summary of the incident logs.
- **Report Generation**: Generates formatted HTML reports suitable for ticketing systems or stakeholder communication.
- **Template-Based Fallback**: Includes standard templates for manual filling if AI analysis is unavailable.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: semantic structure for the application.
- **CSS3**: Custom styling for the dark/light mode interface.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Client-side logic for log processing and masking.

## 📦 Installation & Usage

Since this is a client-side web application, no server installation is required.

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/maveera/soc-incident-analysis-tool.git] or Live: https://maveera.github.io/SOC-Incident-Analysis

    ```

2.  **Run the Application:**

    - *Optional*: For a better development experience, you can serve it using a local server (e.g., Live Server in VS Code or Python `http.server`).

    ```bash
    # Example using Python
    python -m http.server 8000
    # Then navigate to http://localhost:8000/Updateindex.html
    ```
